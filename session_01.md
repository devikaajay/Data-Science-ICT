# Demystifying Terms Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
## Artificial Intelligence
- Technology that creates machines which perform tasks which requires human intelligence.
- 3 types - Narrow/Weak (AI that performs simple tasks)
        - General/Strong (AI that can cope with generalized tasks much like human)
        - Super (AI that can do all human intelligence in all aspects)
## Artificial General Intelligence
- More human like cognitive abilities than AI
- Understanding, learning, and apply knowledge across wide range of talks
## History of Artificial Intelligence
1943 - Artificial Neuron, 1950 - Turing Test, 1956 - Birth of AI, 1957 - Perceptron, 1959 - ADALINE, 1969 - XOR Problem, 1980 - Neocognition, 1986 - Backpropagation, 1989 - UAT, 1995 - SVMs, 1998 - CNN, 2006 - RBM Initialization, 2012 - AlexNet, 2014 - GAN, 2017 - Transformer, 2020 - GPT-3, 2022 - ChatGPT
### Perceptron
- Foundation of Artificial Neural Network
- ML algorithm supervised learning
- Takes 1 or more input and returns a single output
- A decision is made to fire or not fire the neuron
- Mathematical model of biological neuron
### Backpropagation
Method used to train neural networks by calculating the error b/w networks predicted output and actual output, and then propaagating that error backward through the network. It minimizes errors and thereby increase accuracy
### AI Winter
- Geoff Hinton has dedicated his career to making computers learn like humans.
- Hinton was influenced by key figures in AI, particularly Frank Rosenblatt's perceptron model.
- He developed multi-layered neural networks, contributing to significant advancements in AI including self-driving cars and handwriting recognition.
- Hinton faced skepticism and setbacks, often being marginalized at conferences. However, his persistence in pursuing AI advancements paid off.
- 2006 marked a turning point with advanced computing power enabling neural networks to solve complex problems as Hinton envisioned.
- By 2012, AI gained popularity, with Hinton's work prominently featured, demonstrating how neural networks could process images and language.
- Hinton's research significantly contributed to establishing Canada as a major player in the AI field, changing perceptions worldwide.
### DARPA Grand Challenge 2005
- Consists of 50 people from various companies and Stanford.
- Developed a car named Stanley, a modified Volkswagen Touareg.
- Equipped with sensors: 30 laser scanner, conventional camera, and a radar system for detecting vehicles up to 200 meters away.
- Features quick actuation for steering via motor, automated gear shifter for reverse driving, and an emergency stop button.
- Central processing uses six Pentium M-like computers.
- Includes GPS and power inverter systems.
### ImageNet 2012
- Large virtual database designed for visual object detection
- 14 million+ images, 20000 categories each having several 100 images
- Each categories in an image will be indicated in colored bordered bounded boxes
### 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics
- John J Hopfield - USA
- Geoffrey E Hinton - Canada
### Deepseek
- Deepseek r1 model (January 2025) is the first open source model
- Mathematical problem solving to coding and general natural language understanding

## Correlation Vs. Causation
- Correlation --> indicates a statistical relationship b/w two or more variables. This means that variables tend to change together. It can be positive, negative or non existent
- Causation --> One variable directly causes a change in other variable
## Ethics in AI
- Privacy
- Accountability
- Safety
- Transparency
